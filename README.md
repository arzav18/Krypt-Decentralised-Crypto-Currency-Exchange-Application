# Krypt- A Decentralised CryptoCurrency Exchange Application

Krypt is a decentralized blockchain platform that establishes a peer-to-peer network that securely executes and verifies application code, called smart contracts. Smart contracts allow participants to transact with each other without a trusted central authority. Transaction records are immutable, verifiable, and securely distributed across the network, giving participants full ownership and visibility into transaction data. Transactions are sent from and received by user-created Ethereum accounts. A sender must sign transactions and spend Ether, Ethereum native cryptocurrency, as a cost of processing transactions on the network
The main purpose of this project is to provide our customers with fast and secure way
to buy send and receives Ethereum over blockchain; you can easily saw your last
transaction detail easily. In fact, there is similar system on the internet, but they are
less secure found in the existing system.
